# Git and GitHub Project Guide

Welcome to our Git and GitHub project guide for Appleseeds Association students! This guide will help you understand the workflow and steps involved in collaborating on a project using Git and GitHub.

## Project Overview

This project focuses on teaching students how to effectively use Git and GitHub for collaborative work. The project involves opening a new repository, creating branches, making changes, resolving conflicts, and merging branches.

## Project Setup

1. **Repository Creation:** Start by creating a new repository on GitHub. This repository will serve as the central location for your project's files and version history.

2. **Folder Structure:** Inside the repository, create two main folders named "story" and "authors." The "story" folder will contain the main story file, while the "authors" folder will hold individual author information files.

3. **Contributing to the Story:**
   - Inside the "story" folder, create a file named "story.txt." This file is where all team members contribute their parts to the story.

4. **Branching and Tasks:**
   - Each team member should create their own branch from the main branch.
   - Inside their branch:
     1. Create a file in the "authors" folder named `<your_name>.txt` and populate it with your name and some details about yourself.
     2. Add two lines of the story to the "story.txt" file relevant to your part.

5. **Committing and Pulling Changes:**
   - After completing your tasks, commit your changes to your branch.
   - Pull changes from the main branch to ensure you're working with the latest updates. Resolve any conflicts if they arise.

6. **Opening a Pull Request (PR):**
   - Open a Pull Request to merge your branch changes into the main branch.
   - The main creator will review and approve the PR.

## Resolving Conflicts

During the branch merging process, conflicts may arise, especially in the "story.txt" file where multiple team members contribute. In such cases:
- Collaborate with team members to resolve conflicts by accepting both changes and maintaining the flow of the story.
- Communicate effectively to ensure a cohesive and integrated story.

This project aims to teach not only Git and GitHub usage but also effective communication and collaboration skills within a team environment.

Happy collaborating!
