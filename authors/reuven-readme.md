# Git Tutorial Project

This project serves as a tutorial on how to use Git, focusing on the process of creating branches, resolving conflicts, and merging branches in a collaborative environment.

## Overview

In this project, a new repository was created to simulate a collaborative development environment. The project involved four team members, each creating their own branch to work on separate features or tasks. Throughout the process, the team practiced common Git workflows, including branch creation, making changes, and merging branches.

## Key Steps

1. **Repository Creation**: A new repository was created to host the project.
   
2. **Branch Creation**: Each team member created their own branch to work on specific tasks or features.

3. **Work Progression**: Team members made changes to their respective branches, updating files and adding new features as needed.

4. **Conflict Resolution**: During the merging process, conflicts arose in the `story.txt` file as each team member made changes to it. The team practiced resolving conflicts by accepting both sets of changes, ensuring that all contributions were preserved.

5. **Branch Merging**: After resolving conflicts, the branches were successfully merged into the main branch, consolidating all the changes and updates.

## How to Use

To replicate the process and practice Git workflows similar to this project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
2. Create your own branch to work on a specific task or feature:   
    ```bash 
    git checkout -b your-branch-name
3. Make changes to the files in your branch and commit them:
    ```bash 
    git add .
    git commit -m "Your commit message"
4. Push your branch to the remote repository:
    ```bash 
    git push origin your-branch-name
5. Repeat steps 2-4 for each team member working on the project.
6. When ready to merge your changes into the main branch, create a pull request   and resolve any conflicts that arise.
7. Practice conflict resolution by accepting both sets of changes when conflicts occur, ensuring that all contributions are preserved.
8. Once conflicts are resolved, merge the branches into the main branch and verify that the changes are successfully integrated.
